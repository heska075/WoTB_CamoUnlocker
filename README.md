# WoTB_CamoUnlocker
This is a modification for the game World of Tanks Blitz.
Use almost every legendary camouflage available without spending any gold. Keep in mind that this will only affect your local game client, other players will not see these legendary camouflages equipped. Instead, they will appear as the following common camos:
* Rising Fury
* Stellar Shine
* Venomous Shock

 ## In-Game Usage
 After installing the modification, open up the game and select any tank that does have a legendary camouflage by normal. Click on the camo tab and scroll all the way to the top. There you'll find a set of three camouflages, all of which are used to equip a legendary one. Should a tank only have one single legendary camouflage, only the first of these will be useful, the other two will just show your tank without any camo equipped.
 
 This modification will only affect your visuals, other players won't see the legendary camouflage you equipped. Instead, they will be met by you having the camo on that was replaced by the legendary camo you are using.
